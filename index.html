<p>Ever been to the restaurant on the mun? Good food, no atmosphere.</p>
<p>Take-out meals should be referred to as "fly-by's".</p>
<p>Serve snacks and orange-flavored rocket fuel</p>
<p>Hmmm. How about 'The Launch Pad!' for the name then having a running joke on the site where you use 'Launch' in place of 'Lunch.'

You could have different burger sizes set in stages. A One-Stage burger has only one patty, but they go up to a Three-stage.

Instead of 'Well' or Medium' you get 'Full Throttle or Half-throttle'

*thinks of more bad puns*

Milkshakes called Moonshakes and come with little rocket ship straws.</p>
<p>Of course - you're going to serve Mystery Goo, yes?</p>
<p>And what about an "asteroid menu" for the Kerbi-kiddies... :P</p>
<p>How abot making the whole world your restaurant and deliver your meals with ICBMs?</p>
<p>"Vegetable Assembly Building"

A section laid out like a large salad buffet.

"Spaceplane Hamburger"

A buffet to grab grilled food.

"Lunch Pad"

Dining area.

Just some silly ideas. Maybe I should go with dessert names?

A scoop of Minmus pudding? Maybe some Mun rock candy as well? Perhaps even a Dunaght! Or would you prefer plain ol' Ike's cream?

Just some water? Fresh from Laythe! Or maybe some Bop?</p>
